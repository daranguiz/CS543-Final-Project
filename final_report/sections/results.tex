\textit{Clearly describe your experimental protocols. If you are using training and test data, report the numbers of training and test images. Be sure to include example output figures. Quantitative evaluation is always a big plus (if applicable). If you are working with videos, put example output on YouTube or some other external repository and include links in your report.}
