Photography has remained generally unchanged since the first photograph was
taken in 1816 \cite{Beaumont1982_photography}. The proceeding years since have seen a plethora of
technical advances bettering image quality, speed of image capture, as well as
other aspects, but imaging has remained a two-dimensional art. Developments in
recent years, however, have begun to fundamentally alter how we consider
imaging, with the release of the first Xbox Kinect in November 2010 \cite{Alex2009_kinect}.
With this launch, consumers and researchers alike were able to view the world in
three dimensions, opening up a second modality to image processing.
