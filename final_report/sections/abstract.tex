We implement a novel machine learning architecture to perform object recognition using color and low-resolution depth imaging. Our network utilizes pretrained networks for color and depth separately by transforming the depth frame into a color image, then fuses the classification results of the two networks using an additional fully connected layer. We achieve classification results of nearly 70\% and 80\% for the color and depth networks respectively, with less satisfactory results for the full fusion network discussed in the paper.
